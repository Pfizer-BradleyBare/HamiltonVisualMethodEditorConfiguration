Hello. This is the master branch which is an incorrect configuration branch. You need to switch to the correct branch for your system. 

To do so run "git branch" to see the list of available branches.
After run "git checkout <branch>" replacing <branch> with your desired branch name

This file should disappear meaning you did it correctly!!
